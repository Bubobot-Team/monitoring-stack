## Available Stacks

### [Node Exporter - Prometheus - Alert Manager - Grafana Stack](stacks/node-exporter-prometheus-alertmanager-grafana)
A complete monitoring solution that collects system metrics, stores them in Prometheus, manages alerts with AlertManager, and visualizes data through Grafana dashboards. Perfect for monitoring server infrastructure and applications.

This repository contains various monitoring stacks that can be deployed using Ansible. Each stack is designed for specific use cases and includes its own documentation.

To see the available stacks, check the `stacks/` directory. Each stack comes with:
- Ansible deployment configuration
- Docker Compose setup
- Environment configuration
- Detailed documentation

## Quick Start

1. Navigate to the desired stack directory:
   ```bash
   cd stacks/<monitoring-stack>
   ```

2. Edit the inventory file to specify your target hosts:
   ```bash
   # Edit inventory-hosts with your server information
   vim inventory-hosts
   ```

3. Deploy the stack using Ansible:
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i inventory-hosts deploy.yml
   ```

## Stack Configuration

Each stack comes with its own configuration files:
- `inventory-hosts`: Ansible inventory file defining target hosts
- `deploy.yml`: Ansible playbook for deployment
- `docker-compose.yml`: Defines the services and their relationships
- `.env`: Contains environment-specific variables
- `README.md`: Stack-specific documentation

## Adding New Stacks

To add a new monitoring stack:

1. Create a new directory under `stacks/`
2. Include necessary configuration files:
   - `inventory-hosts` for Ansible
   - `deploy.yml` for Ansible deployment
   - `docker-compose.yml` for services
   - `.env` for environment variables
3. Add a README.md with stack-specific instructions
4. Update this main README.md with the new stack information

## Best Practices

- Always use environment variables for sensitive information
- Document any prerequisites or dependencies
- Include example configurations
- Provide clear instructions for deployment and maintenance
- Use Ansible for automated deployment
- Keep inventory files secure and out of version control

## Prerequisites

- Ansible installed on your control machine
- SSH access to target servers
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on target servers
